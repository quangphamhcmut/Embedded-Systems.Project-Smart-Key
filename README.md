<p align="center">
Smart Key system is a project for Embedded Systems course at HCMUT that aims to be a affordable solution to
bring some smart functions back to some old motorcycles. The system consist of 2 subsystems according to a 
key and a lock respectively.

## üìù Specification

### üíª System requirement

Our project's goal is to mimic the commercial smart key system on modern bycicle thus

1. The smartkey system must have a *Smart Key* and a *Smart Lock* subsystems.

2. The smart key subsystem must operate as a key.

    2.1. The key must function as a wireless key.

        2.1.1. The key must be able to communicate wirelessly with the lock.

            2.1.1.1. The key shall operate at a frequency of 2.4 GHz.

            2.1.1.2. The key shall have a communication range of at least 10 meters.

            2.1.1.3. The key shall support proximity detection.

        2.1.2. The key must be optimize for a long term operation.

            2.1.2.1. The key shall be working at least one years under normal using condition.

            2.1.2.2. The power consumption shall be less than 1 mW in sleep mode and less than 50 mW
               during active transmission.

        2.1.3. The key must have security features.

            2.1.3.1. The key must support rolling code encryption or challange-response authentication
               to prevent replay attacks.

            2.1.3.2. The key should implement frequency hopping to minimize RF interference and improve
               security.

        2.1.4. The key should be durable and environmental resist.

            2.1.4.1. The key shall be rated as IP65 protection standard to ensure resistance again dust
               and water splashes.

            2.1.4.2. The key shall operate with a temperature range of -10¬∞C to 60¬∞C. 

        2.1.5. The key should have lock/unlock and horn burst functions.

    2.2. The key hardware should be afforable and easy to build.

        2.2.1. The key should include 2 buttons for lock/unlock-ing and horn bursting features.

        2.2.2. The key shall be powered by a wide-available, repplaceable 3V battery.

3. The smart lock subsystem must function as a lock.

4. The system should use low-price components and easy to source.
